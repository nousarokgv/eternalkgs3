39:04.926 --> 39:07.803
Your pockets aren't empty.
Damn.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.139
I'll take my cutter back.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.439
Stupid ass.

39:20.025 --> 39:23.527
Hey, man, I figured you
had like 12 or 13 of these.

39:23.611 --> 39:24.737
You're not too bright,
are you?

39:24.821 --> 39:26.405
Just get out of here.
Get out of here.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.907
Same old Rome doing
the same old stupid shit.

39:28.992 --> 39:30.284
Get off me, man.

39:30.577 --> 39:34.455
Look, running your mouth?
Insulting people?
Stealing Verone's shit?

39:34.789 --> 39:37.207
You think I'm gonna let
somebody stare me down?

39:37.292 --> 39:40.044
I didn't let nobody
stare me down in
jail, homeboy.

39:40.128 --> 39:42.629
You think I'm gonna
let it fly on a beach?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.966
"And you,
I'll take my cutter back."

39:46.301 --> 39:47.801
His rich ass.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.137
And you're packing.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.597
Like you ain't.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.892
Exactly.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.560
From here on out,
I do the talking.

39:56.644 --> 39:58.812
You want to do
more than that.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.314
What's that supposed to mean?

40:00.398 --> 40:04.276
It means you're always
getting in trouble
over a female, Brian.
