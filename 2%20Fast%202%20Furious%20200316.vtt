16:06.382 --> 16:09.843
So, how long you been
in South Florida?

16:10.595 --> 16:12.554
A while.
Before that?

16:15.892 --> 16:18.977
We know
you're Brian O'Conner,
formerly of the LAPD.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.938
Man, you got the wrong guy.
Really?

16:26.903 --> 16:28.654
How you doing,
O'Conner?

16:31.949 --> 16:33.408
Let's take a walk.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.579
Carter Verone.

16:38.039 --> 16:41.249
Born in Argentina,
but he's lived most
of his life in Miami.

16:41.751 --> 16:44.836
Now he owns the biggest
import-export business
in the state.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.339
You see, unfortunately,
the cartels have been
successful

16:47.423 --> 16:48.924
getting drugs into Miami.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.218
But they've had a hard time
getting the cash out.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.095
We've been surveilling him
for a year.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.847
But we've never been able
to put him and the money
together.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.600
We've swept his house,
his warehouses...
Nothing.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.020
Customs here
has done a great job
of getting us this far.
