55:07.888 --> 55:09.973
Now what's that make you?

55:10.224 --> 55:12.475
Where's he at?
He's on his way.

55:12.559 --> 55:14.727
You and Verone don't
go everywhere together?

55:15.020 --> 55:17.522
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

55:21.026 --> 55:23.987
I'm gonna go take a piss.
You go do that.

55:28.409 --> 55:30.076
What is his deal?

55:30.577 --> 55:32.412
He doesn't trust people
who carry badges.

55:32.496 --> 55:34.497
So you talk
like you know.

55:37.167 --> 55:39.419
I'd been a cop
about two months

55:39.503 --> 55:41.671
when Roman was busted
in a garage raid.

55:42.047 --> 55:45.675
He had eight sets of wheels
in his possession, each one
of them hot.

55:45.759 --> 55:47.510
So you busted him?

55:47.594 --> 55:49.804
No,
I didn't even know
it was going down.

55:49.888 --> 55:51.931
But that doesn't
really matter to him.

55:53.267 --> 55:55.226
Basically,
once I became a cop,

55:55.310 --> 55:57.979
Roman
saw me as a friend
who became the enemy.

56:04.403 --> 56:07.030
Is there anything
I can get for you,
Mr. Verone?
