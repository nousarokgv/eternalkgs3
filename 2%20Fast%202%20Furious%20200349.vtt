49:01.856 --> 49:05.442
Second wave's got to sit tight
till your partner crosses
this line right here.

49:05.526 --> 49:08.570
First team to go down
and back twice wins
the race.

49:08.904 --> 49:10.697
At which point,

49:11.866 --> 49:15.410
the losers will
hand over them keys.

49:15.536 --> 49:19.039
Otherwise
you'll be eating breakfast
through straws from now on.

49:22.418 --> 49:23.752
I get it.

49:25.212 --> 49:26.880
This means you, too.

49:28.049 --> 49:29.174
I got it.

49:29.258 --> 49:31.343
All right. Let's race.

49:35.681 --> 49:38.933
Come on, baby,
you got this, Rome!
This dude ain't serious.

49:39.060 --> 49:42.520
Yeah, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.

49:44.065 --> 49:45.523
You about to lose your car.

49:45.608 --> 49:47.692
Do it, Rome!
Come on, bitch,
you got it, man.

49:47.777 --> 49:51.988
You think I'm worried
about this fool, man?
This is nothing!
