18:04.041 --> 18:05.250
So, Dunn,

18:08.337 --> 18:10.589
looks like we're
going to be partners, bro.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.591
Could you tell me,
what would be
a better motor

18:12.675 --> 18:15.302
for my Skyline,
a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?

18:20.516 --> 18:21.767
Twenty four.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.312
I didn't know
pizza places made motors.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.275
See, man, come on,
I can't do this.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.569
I mean, seriously, if this
is what you're gonna give me,

18:32.653 --> 18:35.113
I may as well
take my chances in Chino.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.824
We'll get
someone else.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.285
No way, man.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.624
The only way I'll do this is
if I get to pick the driver.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.836
All right, O'Conner.
Who you got in mind?

18:50.421 --> 18:52.672
This dude I grew up with
in Barstow.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.007
Who's that?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.092
Roman Pearce.
