17:02.105 --> 17:04.147
I'm just here to help
get them over the top.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.650
I was able to get
an agent in undercover,

17:06.734 --> 17:08.944
working travel
and logistics for him.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.697
Recently Verone put her
in charge of finding
some new drivers.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.283
Right, although
we can't confirm
her status right now.

17:15.576 --> 17:19.121
You think she's flipped?
She's one of mine.
She's all right.

17:19.205 --> 17:23.291
She's been in with Verone
nearly a year. Even lives
at the compound with him now.

17:23.376 --> 17:27.504
Look, it was the FBI's idea
to bring you in here.
I'm against it.

17:27.797 --> 17:31.675
But we need some good drivers
that can put this asshole
and his money together.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.177
You're gonna roll
with Agent Dunn here.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.096
And if I don't?

17:36.514 --> 17:39.182
Here's a list of the
laws you broke in L.A.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.894
Obstruction of justice,
aiding and abetting.
You know the rap sheet.

17:42.979 --> 17:46.523
We can
make this all go away
in the interest of justice

17:47.358 --> 17:49.067
if you're willing
to play ball.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.318
Yeah.

17:52.697 --> 17:56.616
So what's the idea here?
Dunn and I are supposed
to be street racers?

17:56.701 --> 17:57.993
That's right.
