48:01.754 --> 48:03.588
No, actually
we just figured
those cars you got

48:03.673 --> 48:06.758
deserve better drivers,
which is why we're gonna
take them off your hands.

48:06.842 --> 48:08.260
You know,
why don't we
settle this now?

48:08.344 --> 48:11.137
Wait, wait, wait.
How about we settle
this on the blacktop?

48:11.472 --> 48:15.308
Each car does
a down-and-back,
tag-team style. For slips.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.060
Loser walks home.

48:17.144 --> 48:19.771
We came to race.
Load them up then.

48:23.526 --> 48:25.443
Come on, bro,
let's get these cars.

48:27.280 --> 48:30.824
All right, check it out.
There's no way we're gonna
beat these guys straight up.

48:30.908 --> 48:33.326
That Hemi's putting out
about 425

48:33.452 --> 48:36.788
and that Yenko
will snap a speedo in
about five seconds flat.

48:37.456 --> 48:39.583
We're gonna have to
pull something out
of our ass.

48:39.667 --> 48:42.252
The only thing I can think of
is save the spray for the
way back.

48:42.336 --> 48:43.336
The return trip.

48:43.713 --> 48:46.006
Done deal.
All right, let's do this, bro.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.008
I'm getting
that orange one.

48:50.428 --> 48:52.053
You ain't ready, Fabio!

48:56.809 --> 48:57.934
All right.

48:58.060 --> 49:01.521
You each got a barrel
to go around down at
the end of the road here.
