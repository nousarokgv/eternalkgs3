That's why Markham knew
we were gonna be at
that impound lot.

43:06.668 --> 43:10.212
Yo, you the master mechanic.
Why don't you just yank
that shit out?

43:10.463 --> 43:12.756
I'll try,
but this ain't LoJack.

43:12.882 --> 43:16.843
The DIS box, the
engine management system,
hell, the main harness,

43:17.011 --> 43:18.845
the GPS is spidered
into all of that.

43:18.930 --> 43:20.472
Hey, tell me something, man.

43:20.682 --> 43:22.975
Do I even want to know
where the Skyline is,
dawg?

43:23.059 --> 43:25.018
Or where you've been
the past couple of days

43:25.103 --> 43:27.020
or where the hell
you got these rides from?

43:27.647 --> 43:29.648
They're hot.
Yeah, they hot.

43:29.732 --> 43:31.817
They wired
so hot that whoever's
tracking these things

43:31.901 --> 43:34.236
would know every time
you don't wear your
seat belt.

43:37.115 --> 43:38.198
All right, Jimmy.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.742
Just do what you can do, bro.
I got you.

43:40.868 --> 43:42.202
Thanks, man.

43:42.370 --> 43:44.955
Man, we need to get
these on the street
ASAP.

43:46.207 --> 43:47.708
Hey, bro, check it out.

43:48.084 --> 43:50.711
See that Cadillac
across the street
over there?

43:54.173 --> 43:55.465
Yeah.

43:55.550 --> 43:58.427
Yeah, well, they've
been on us ever since
we left Verone's house.
