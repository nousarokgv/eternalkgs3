01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:03.897
Copy.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:07.317
Sir, we've got Verone
on the move to the airstrip.

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:10.195
Good.
Let's get a bird in the air.
Tell him to keep his distance.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.199
- Ready to go.
- Thanks.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:18.036
You're all set.
Thanks.

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:21.164
All set?
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:25.377
Report.

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:29.714
What's going on
out there?

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:32.801
Team One, checking in.

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:35.053
Team Two, checking in.
Team Three, checking in.

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:37.889
Team Four,

Team Five,
checking in.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.978
Team Six, all clear.

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:50.944
Here we go.
Yeah, so
you know what to do.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:53.071
- Stay cool.
- Keep focused.

01:14:53.573 --> 01:14:56.158
Remember the airstrip's
off Nallwood Avenue.

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:58.493
It's the third exit
after the bridge.

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:01.371
Got it.
