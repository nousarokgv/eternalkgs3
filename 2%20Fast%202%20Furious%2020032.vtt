02:10.714 --> 02:13.257
All right, ladies! We're good.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.384
We're good.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.678
That's it, babies.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.309
Come on, Tej!
Let's get this race going!

02:23.393 --> 02:26.103
Whoa, whoa, man.
Wait a second, man.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.231
You cats are first wave, man.
Where's your fourth at?

02:28.899 --> 02:32.109
It was Joaquin, man,
but he had to work
the graveyard shift.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.487
- What?
- Graveyard shift, man.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.781
Why don't you
run with us, Tej?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.575
Hell, no, I'm not running
with y'all, man.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.538
And I tell you what, either
you find a fourth or you
don't race. How about that?

02:43.622 --> 02:47.124
We should find two,
so we don't have to
roll with skirt here.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.382
Whoa, wait a second,
wait a second.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.300
Why don't I just
find y'all a fourth

02:56.385 --> 02:58.594
and we settle this
on the streets?

02:58.679 --> 03:00.888
Bring him on.
Anybody I want?
