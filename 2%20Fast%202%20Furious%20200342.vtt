42:08.109 --> 42:11.945
How you feeling, man?
You all right? Thank you.

42:13.656 --> 42:15.115
Not too bad.

42:17.327 --> 42:20.787
I see you're
about your money,
homey. You race, too?

42:22.248 --> 42:26.418
No, man. I hit a wall
doing like a buck 20
a couple years ago.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.546
Ever since then,
I've just been organizing
and collecting, man.

42:29.631 --> 42:31.798
Hey, Tej, check it out.
He's gonna be in town
for a while.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.675
Is there any way
he could use
that cot?

42:35.136 --> 42:37.596
What's wrong
with your place, man?
No.

42:38.264 --> 42:41.266
I don't want
to stay with him.
He got bad habits.

42:42.936 --> 42:46.730
All right, man, whatever.
Show him around. I'll be
up there in a minute.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.148
Thanks.
Sure.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.985
All right,
who wants a chance
to win their money back?

42:52.695 --> 42:55.989
So, Jimmy? So,
what's up, you ever seen
anything like this before?

42:56.282 --> 42:59.534
No.
Both of them are wired
like I never seen before.

42:59.619 --> 43:00.786
What?

43:00.995 --> 43:02.788
Yeah, man,
they got us
wired with GPS.
