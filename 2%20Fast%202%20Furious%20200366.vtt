01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:16.096
Y'all still mad
about y'all car?

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:19.058
Don't even trip, homey.
Come on, man,
can't you take a joke?

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:23.062
All right, this isn't about
being a good cop any more
or doing your job.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:25.105
They're gonna kill you.
You guys gotta pull out.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:27.441
Verone pay y'all
to keep a straight
face like that?

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:31.570
'Cause if I was making money,
shit, I'd get that mole
removed off my damn nose.

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:33.656
Okay?
Yeah.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.908
How much he pay y'all anyway?

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:39.578
Every time I see y'all, man,
y'all got the silk shirts on,

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.997
jewelry, you know,
looking real Miami.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:44.375
I caught you
walking up in the club,

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:46.960
you got the hamburger meat
all hanging out.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.423
Don't make that run, Brian.
Don't make that run.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:53.676
Be careful.
