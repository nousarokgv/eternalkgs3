Man, Tej's garage
is ridiculous.

40:17.165 --> 40:18.582
He's got the best
of everything.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.334
Snap-on tools.
All these lifts are brand new.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.003
They're only maybe
a couple of months old.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.755
Hey, yo, Jimmy.
What's up, man?

40:24.839 --> 40:26.131
Hey,
what up, Bullitt?

40:26.216 --> 40:27.883
That's Rome right there.
Do me a favor.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.469
When you get a second,
I want you to check out
the Evo and Spyder.

40:30.553 --> 40:31.595
Make sure
everything's copasetic.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.597
Evo?
Where'd you
get an Evo from?

40:33.681 --> 40:35.933
It's a long story.
I got you, man.

40:36.017 --> 40:37.768
Thanks, Jimmy.
Come check this out.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.854
Man,
it's so hot and humid,
I can't even wear drawers.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.648
Man, tell me about it.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.776
Look at all this potential
out here.

40:45.860 --> 40:49.196
Ray, don't do that, man.
You're making me lose money.

40:50.365 --> 40:53.325
Come on, stop that.
I know you're better
than that. Come on.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.161
Damn.
