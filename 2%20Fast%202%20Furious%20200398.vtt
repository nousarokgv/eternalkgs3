01:38:21.604 --> 01:38:23.939
So maybe there were six bags.

01:38:24.899 --> 01:38:26.900
I guess we can call it even.

01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:28.986
Agent Dunn?
Sir.

01:38:32.782 --> 01:38:34.700
We found some more evidence.

01:38:36.619 --> 01:38:38.287
Come on,
let's take it to the truck.

01:38:42.792 --> 01:38:45.043
Don't drop the soap,
big homey.

01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:50.799
I hope you know that
when he gets out,
he's going to kill your ass.

01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:53.844
He ain't getting out.

01:38:55.597 --> 01:38:57.014
I'll see you soon.

01:38:57.557 --> 01:39:00.559
You think
he's going to get out?
He'll be out.

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:04.187
Not for real. You think
he's getting out, dawg?
