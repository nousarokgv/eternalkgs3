37:05.390 --> 37:07.683
We did all that
for a damn cigar?

37:08.143 --> 37:10.477
No. You did that for a job.

37:17.235 --> 37:21.071
Do you really think that
I would let somebody
impound my car?

37:25.243 --> 37:26.952
The boatyard is mine.

37:27.871 --> 37:30.205
By the way,
you two owe me a gate.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.458
I'll just take it
off your cut.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.171
Off our cut?
Yeah.

37:38.548 --> 37:40.341
I like that.
Good.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.344
What's this job
you got for us,
anyway?

37:43.470 --> 37:44.595
Come with me.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.513
The house has ears in it.

37:48.642 --> 37:52.478
I have something
I want you to carry
from North Beach to the Keys.

37:52.562 --> 37:53.771
What is it?

37:53.855 --> 37:56.106
Just put in the car
what I tell you to
and drive it to me

37:56.191 --> 37:58.025
and don't let anybody
stop you. Understand?

37:58.109 --> 38:00.653
Yeah. Any chance
of cop trouble?

38:00.737 --> 38:02.071
No, I'm buying you
a window of time

38:02.155 --> 38:04.657
but it's not gonna
be open very long.
