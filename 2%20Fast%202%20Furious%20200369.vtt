01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:11.814
Okay.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.400
I'll see you later.

01:09:24.744 --> 01:09:26.161
Nice shirt, Bilkins.

01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:28.163
It's my day off.
Yeah.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.708
Well, anyhow,
this is the deal.

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:35.587
Last night,
Verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

01:09:35.672 --> 01:09:39.174
We're driving to an airstrip
in the Keys, off Nallwood
Avenue.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:41.510
Verone has a plane there
and he's taking off for
good.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:43.470
Wait a minute.
How do you know this?

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.180
Monica.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.308
She's doing her job.
She warned us.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:49.935
She warned you about what?

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.479
Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

01:09:52.564 --> 01:09:55.816
Driving into an ambush
was never part of the deal.
I'm calling this off.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.361
Like hell you are.
This is a Customs
case, Bilkins.

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:01.613
No one's calling
this off unless I do.
