45:02.950 --> 45:04.618
Don't tell me to shut up,
Brian!

45:04.702 --> 45:07.162
You almost blew our cover,
old man!
I'm right here.

45:07.246 --> 45:09.164
You shouldn't have
shown up like you did.

45:09.248 --> 45:11.291
You didn't know
Verone was testing us?

45:11.376 --> 45:13.460
No, I thought
you punks were running!
Running?

45:13.544 --> 45:15.837
That's great.
That's real great!

45:15.922 --> 45:19.758
And if Rome wanted to
shoot you? You wouldn't
be here right now.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.636
All right, we got to
get this under control.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.059
That's mine!

45:29.227 --> 45:30.394
So?

45:31.354 --> 45:32.479
Tell me what you know.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.981
Rome and I will be
making a run for Verone.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.900
I'm not sure when or where,

45:36.984 --> 45:38.777
but he did say that
he bought us a window,

45:38.861 --> 45:40.404
I'm assuming
from the local cops.

45:40.488 --> 45:42.989
I can talk to some of
the guys at the local
P. D.

45:43.324 --> 45:46.159
No. No good.
If Verone's got some
of them on the payroll,

45:46.244 --> 45:48.495
then we can't let them
know our operation.

45:48.579 --> 45:49.871
Exactly.

45:50.248 --> 45:54.376
In addition, Verone told us
that he himself would be
waiting at the drop.

45:54.544 --> 45:56.253
That's good news.

45:56.671 --> 45:58.588
If you're
gonna be delivering
drug money to him,

45:58.673 --> 46:00.465
then we can get
him for laundering.

46:00.550 --> 46:02.926
Now, there's only one problem.
What's that?
