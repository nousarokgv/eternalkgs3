46:03.010 --> 46:04.344
Fuentes.

46:04.679 --> 46:05.971
Verone's tapping her.

46:06.055 --> 46:07.097
Tapping her?

46:07.181 --> 46:09.266
Tapping her how?
That is crap.

46:09.350 --> 46:11.726
Now what you
talking about, homeboy?
We know what we seen.

46:11.811 --> 46:13.437
So what do you think,
O'Conner?

46:13.521 --> 46:15.856
You think she's compromised?
You should know.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.566
What's that
supposed to mean?

46:17.650 --> 46:19.734
Your old pal O'Conner
didn't tell you?

46:19.819 --> 46:21.862
He flipped on
Bilkins in L.A.

46:21.946 --> 46:24.865
He gave his
mark his car keys
and let him disappear.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.284
That's why
he's not a cop any more.

46:29.370 --> 46:31.329
So what do you think,
expert?

46:32.832 --> 46:34.040
Man, I don't know.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.626
All right.
We'll keep
an eye on her.

46:38.129 --> 46:39.880
We're out of here.

46:46.679 --> 46:48.346
Let your man go?

46:48.890 --> 46:50.640
Drop it.
I don't wanna
talk about it.

46:50.725 --> 46:53.560
Drop it, hell.
I want to hear
about this, homey.

46:53.895 --> 46:55.729
I said, forget about it, cuz.

46:55.855 --> 46:57.981
We got Fuentes
in with Verone,

46:58.733 --> 47:00.650
Markham trying
to blow our cover,

47:00.735 --> 47:04.821
and we got two wired cars
that are no better than that
damn ankle bracelet of mine.

47:04.906 --> 47:06.114
I'm gonna tell you, bruh,

47:06.199 --> 47:09.159
you let Markham
do that shit again
in front of Verone,
