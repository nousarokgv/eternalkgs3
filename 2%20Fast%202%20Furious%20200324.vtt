24:07.238 --> 24:09.280
And you need to
stop blaming me
for your every mistake.

24:09.365 --> 24:12.659
And Roman Pearce needs to
start taking responsibility
for his own actions.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.077
You need to go to hell.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.246
And you need to
go back to Barstow.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.126
I'm not going back to Barstow.

24:31.971 --> 24:35.390
Brian O'Conner, Roman Pearce,
meet Monica Fuentes.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.975
Do they have background
on Verone?

24:37.059 --> 24:38.059
They've been briefed.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.603
Good.
All right,
here's the deal.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.773
Verone's looking for drivers.
I've arranged for both of you
to join up.

24:43.858 --> 24:46.151
I've also hired some thugs,
you know, to make it legit.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.403
When do we start?
Right now.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.155
What are we driving?

24:57.705 --> 25:00.623
Don't even think about
taking the convertible.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.750
It might
loosen your mousse.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.587
That's cool.
That's too much
chrome for me anyways.

25:05.671 --> 25:10.300
Damn! Where do you all
confiscate these rims
from, man?
