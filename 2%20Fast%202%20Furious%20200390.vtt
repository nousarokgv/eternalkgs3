01:30:00.479 --> 01:30:02.438
Get off at Tarpon Point.

01:30:03.273 --> 01:30:06.317
Tarpon Point?
There's no airstrip
at Tarpon Point.

01:30:07.444 --> 01:30:09.820
Who said anything
about an airstrip?

01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:24.460
Brian?

01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:27.088
Brian, man,
what's the hold-up, bro?

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:29.590
Yo, bro. There's a new plan.
What the hell?

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:33.219
We're meeting him
at the Tarpon Point exit,
not the airstrip.

01:30:33.303 --> 01:30:36.472
So, what are you saying?
Like I said,
there's a new plan.

01:30:39.017 --> 01:30:40.226
Brian?

01:30:40.811 --> 01:30:42.853
Brian? Hello, you there?

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:45.981
Damn!

01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:47.441
Yo, what the hell
is he doing?

01:30:47.526 --> 01:30:49.276
The feds are
in the wrong place.

01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:51.529
Brian's woman is on her own
with Verone.

01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:52.655
So...

01:30:52.739 --> 01:30:54.698
So Brian's not coming!
