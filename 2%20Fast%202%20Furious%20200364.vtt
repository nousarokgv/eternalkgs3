01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:02.505
She had to, man.
He was testing her.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:05.549
You got to remember,
her ass is on the line,
just like ours.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.427
You're feeling this girl
way too much.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:12.264
She's like that
crazy-ass trailer rat
from back in the day, Tanya.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:15.434
Tanya?
Man, you went out
with her after I did.

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:18.771
I mean,
I couldn't let
it go to waste.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.731
- I got you. I got you.
- I got you.

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:22.316
Is that right?

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.277
We go race for cash,
but when I step on the gas,

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:28.531
my nitrous go blast,
leave your ass in the past.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:30.866
Tej, you about to
lose your garage.

01:04:30.951 --> 01:04:32.368
Whatever, man.

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:35.120
I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but I overcharge.

01:04:35.247 --> 01:04:38.040
Pay me! Let's go, man.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.000
Pay me my money.
I told you, man.

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:43.546
I'm glad you're happy man.
I'm so glad. This is my
garage, boy.

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:46.090
Royal flush.
Give me this, man.

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:48.008
You got to talk to him,
talk to him.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.969
Damn, you can't play
and play it for long.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.846
Put that money
back on the table.
You know it's mine next hand.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:55.891
Jimmy, how are you gonna
pay me back if you keep
losing to Tej like that?

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.142
How you doing, bro?
Real good.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.937
I'm going to crash, Tej.
I'll catch you tomorrow.
